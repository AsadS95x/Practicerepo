# get an error as you have to pass the line for 
# the variable to be defined so type in n and press 
# enter. Then try p a again, you should get a return of 'aaa'. 
# Now if you type q and press enter you will quit the program.

# Now run the program again go the final line by typing n 
# and enter repeatedly. Now type p final and you should 
# get aaabbbccc returned.



# Note: pdb.set_trace() will not trace within functions unless
#  it is called within the function's block of code:

## This will follow the return line in the declaration
#  of final and once again when it is called 
# by the print function.
